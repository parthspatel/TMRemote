Hello!
We are TMRemote, a remote bot management service for Terminal enabling our customers to manage bots over a simplified web service.

Some of the services that we offer are:
 - monitoring
 - ban detection (similar to gm detect by Blight Trainer)
 - remote logout

We are in the process of implementing all the features of terminal so that you can fully manage all your bots from TMRemote.

With this most recent patch 11/1/2018 Terminal was being detected by MapleStory.  With TMRemote you can crash all of the bots from any internet browser and not have to worry about the integrity of your bots.

Please check us out at https://beta.tmremote.io for a more user-friendly bot management solution and peace of mind.
